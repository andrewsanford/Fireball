# Fireball
Program that automatically rolls and accounts for modifications for the spell Fireball

# Description
I play Dungeons and Dragons weekly with a group of friends, and one spell that comes up all the time is Fireball. Its damage scales really well with the character's level, the area of effect is large, and it has  several outside features available to it to buff its mechanics. This program rolls the damage of Fireball, and also accounts for any modifications to either the damage total, or the damage of each individual die.

# Mechanics
Elemental Adept (Fire): When you roll damage for a spell you cast that deals fire damage, you can treat any 1 on a damage die as a 2.

Elemental Affinity (Fire): When you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

Empowered Evocation: You can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any Wizard Evocation spell you cast.

Empowered Spell: When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to Reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

Flames Of Phlegethos: When you roll fire damage for a spell you cast, you can reroll any roll of 1 on the fire damage dice, but you must use the new roll, even if it is another 1.

Overchannel: When you cast a Wizard spell of 1st through 5th Level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

Power Surge: Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with a wizard spell, you can spend one power surge to deal extra force damage to that target. The extra damage equals half your wizard level.

Spell Bombardment: When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.
